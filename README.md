# Netflix Landing Page Clone
A Netflix Clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that recreates the modern look and feel of the Netflix homepage. It includes a responsive hero section, navigation bar, and multiple movie sliders with smooth scrolling powered by JavaScript. CSS hover effects make the thumbnails interactive, while JavaScript adds slider controls and FAQ toggles for better user experience. The layout adjusts across screen sizes, ensuring a clean and polished UI on mobile, tablet, and desktop. This project helps build strong front-end skills in responsive design, dynamic UI behavior, and real-world website cloning.
